## How does the curriculum work?

The goal of each chapter is to demonstrate practical concepts you'll likely use the most in the working world. Some chapters will cover more concepts than are required to complete the final assignment. 

1. Type out every code sample.
2. Complete every exercise.
3. Complete every assignment.

All of the code samples and assignments can be found in the [examples](examples/) directory.
